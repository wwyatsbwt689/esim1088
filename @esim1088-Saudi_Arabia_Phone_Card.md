Our phone cards offer a variety of options to suit your needs, whether you're looking for a simple prepaid SIM card or a data-heavy plan.

Imagine streaming your favorite shows without worrying about data limits or navigating through new cities with ease thanks to accurate GPS mapsâ€”our data cards ensure you won't miss out on anything.

For those who prefer flexibility, our eSIM solutions are revolutionary. Unlike traditional physical SIM cards, eSIMs allow you to instantly activate your service via an app on your smartphone. No more waiting at airports or hunting down local stores; simply download the app, follow the instructions, and voilaâ€”you have instant access to Saudi Arabia's top mobile networks. This option is particularly handy for frequent travelers who donâ€™t want the hassle of swapping out physical SIMs every time they visit a new country.

Each of our phone cards undergoes rigorous testing to ensure compatibility with your device and seamless integration with Saudi Arabian networks.
