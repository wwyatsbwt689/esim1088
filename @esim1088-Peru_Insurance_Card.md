For those who prefer physical SIM cards, our prepaid options allow you to top up as needed. This is perfect for travelers who want flexibility and donâ€™t want to commit to long-term contracts.

No more waiting in line at the airport to buy a SIM card!

And hereâ€™s a pro tip: whether youâ€™re using a SIM card or an eSIM, always check the network coverage in the areas you plan to visit. Peru has excellent coverage in major cities like Lima, Cusco, and Arequipa, but remote areas might have limited service. Make sure to test your connection before heading out on any excursions.

So, whether youâ€™re packing for a quick weekend getaway or a month-long journey across Peru, the Peru Insurance Card and our mobile solutions are here to make your trip seamless and enjoyable. Donâ€™t forget to grab yours today!
